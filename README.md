# PenguinHood
Created with C# and the Unity Engine by Andrew Yin Li for Oberlin College Winter Term 2017.

The 'ArcherPenguin' directory contains the Unity Project and Visual Studio solution to the project. It is named as such because 'ArcherPenguin' was the original name for the project.

The 'Functioning Build' directory contains the .exe for the game and the data folder for the game.
