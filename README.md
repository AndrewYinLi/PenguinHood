# penguin-hood
Created with C# and the Unity Engine by Andrew Yin Li for Oberlin College Winter Term 2017.

I coded the game from scratch and all the sprites and graphics used in the game were created independently by me.

This project helped me further my understanding of many basic and intermediate Unity game engine and game design concepts, such as: developing your own player controller instead of using the PlayerController component native to Unity, plotting the dots to an arc through trignometry (used by the player to aim the arrow in an arc), projectile movement, raycasting via the RayCast2D component, and hitboxes. 


The 'ArcherPenguin' directory contains the Unity Project. It is named ArcherPenguin rather than PenguinHood or something similar because I thought it would be cool to have a codename for the project, similar to how companies have codenames for unreleased titles in early development! The 'Functioning Build' directory contains the .exe for the game and the data folder for the game.
